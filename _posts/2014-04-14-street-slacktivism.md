The term street slacktivism sounds like an oxymoron at first but let me explain.

First, for the unfamiliars, here is the definition of slacktivism by Oxford Dictionary<sup>[1]</sup>:

> **Slacktivism** [MASS NOUN] informal
> <br>
> <br>
>Actions performed via the Internet in support of a political or social cause but regarded as requiring little time or involvement, e.g. signing an online petition or joining a campaign group on a social media website:
>
> <br>
> _'such email alerts make slacktivism easy'_

That definition suggests that those participating in street protest shall be considered as doing something more beneficial for their ultimate purpose, the target. Well, Gezi Parki protest have already proved that mistake on June 2013.

What happened in Gezi Parki back then?
--------------------------------------

Let's recall what happened in Gezi Parki again.

The protest aganist a shopping mall which was planned to be built instead of Gezi Parki, broke out and spread to nation-wide after police's violent crack down. Millions of protesters were in streets for several days demanding the cease of police violance and of cuting down the trees for mall construction. The main area of the protests was Taksim Square, located next to Gezi Parki.

In a short period of time, the protests turned into anti-government acts and spread all cities all over Turkey except 2 small ones.

Why no success?
---------------

During the protests, leftists and opposition media assigned too much meaning to Gezi Parki protests. They almost turned it into a holly fight resulting in failure to realize the ineffectiveness and poor organization of the acts. They thought of Gezi Parki protests as an awakening of the nation. Leftists believed that the nation finally saw the corruptions and religious abuse on politics and oncoming sharia thread.

But unfortunately "the nation" was much more crowded than they could see. Leftists were only considering the people in the streets and balconies who supported them but were ignoring the rest. This would be the root cause of the defeat in the elections which is the only chance to change things in Turkey, other than a Nato supported military coup.

Like in everywhere in the world, the government-influenced main stream media is very strong in Turkey yet leftists underestimated the media's power to manipulate mass perception of reality. The main stream media showed the protests as if it was a terorist attack carried out by leftists who were eager for violence and did it like a gripping Hollywood movie. By the time, Leftists were fighting against police to give classical, pages long and boring press statements which nobody really cares. Oh, they also were very successfully and active on Twitter where only "elites" have enough money to reach out. Vast majority of people were still being exposed to main stream media.

As a result nothing really changed, red voters voted red, blue voters voted blue and Tayyip is the prime minister again by gaining almost the same percentage of votes.

Street Slacktivism
------------------

When we pour into streets rather than posting status updates to social media sites, we just seem to be doing something for changing things, but changing things starts in people's minds. Have you ever imagined how repellent you seem from a coservative's eyes when you hit the streets with all those masks and slings? I am already on your side. You need to persuade Tayyip's supporters to be with you yet you are doing the the most misleading thing you could do: giving a reason to people for hating you and believing how right they are to support what they support (Tayyip in this example). 

It has no greater impact on things we want to change, so pouring into streets just to fight against police and giving boring press statements should be considered as slactivism as well.
