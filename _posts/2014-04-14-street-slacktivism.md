The term street slacktivism sounds like an oxymoron at first but let me explain.

First, for the unfamiliars, here is the definition of slacktivism by Oxford Dictionary<sup>[1]</sup>:

> **Slacktivism** [MASS NOUN] informal
> <br>
> <br>
>Actions performed via the Internet in support of a political or social cause but regarded as requiring little time or involvement, e.g. signing an online petition or joining a campaign group on a social media website:
>
> <br>
> _'such email alerts make slacktivism easy'_

That definition suggests that those participate to street protest shall be considered as doing something more beneficial for their ultimate purpose, the target. Well, Gezi Parki protest have already proved that wrong on June 2013.

What happened in Gezi Parki back then?
--------------------------------------

Let's recall what happened in Gezi Parki again.

The protest aganist a shopping mall which is planned to be built instead of Gezi Parki, broke out and spread nation wide after police's violent crack down. Millions of protesters were in streets for several days demanding stopping of police violance and stopping of cutting trees for mall building. The main area of the protests was Taksim Square, located next to Gezi Parki.

In short period of time, the protests turn into anti-government acts and spread all cities of Turkey except 2 little ones.

Why no success?
---------------

During the protests, leftists and opposition media assign too much meaning to Gezi Parki protests. They almost turn it into a holly fight resulting in failing to realize the ineffectiveness and poor organization of the acts. They think of Gezi Parki protests as an awakening of the nation. Leftists believe that the nation finally saw the corruptions and religious abuse on politics and incoming sharia thread.

But unfortunately "the nation" was much more crowded than they could see. Leftists were only counting the people in the streets and balconies who support them but were ignoring the rest. This will be the root cause of the defeat in the elections which is the only chance to change things in Turkey, other than a Nato supported military coup.

Like everywhere in the world, the government influenced main stream media is very strong in Turkey yet leftists underestimate the media's power to manipulate mass perception of reality. The main stream media showed the protests as if it is a terorist attack carried out by leftists who are eager for violence and did it like a gripping Hollywood movie. By the time Leftists were fighting police to give classical, pages long and boring press statements which nobody really cares. Oh they also were very successfully and active on Twitter where only elites has enough money to reach out. Vast majority of people were still being exposed to main stream media.

As a result nothing really changed, red voters voted red, blue voters voted blue and Tayyip is the prime minister again by almost the same percentage of votes.

Street Slacktivism
------------------

When we go on streets rather than posting status updates to social media sites we just seem to be doing something to change things, but changing things starts from people's minds. Have you ever imagined how repellent you seem from a coservative's eyes when you are in streets with all those masks and slings? I am already on your side. You need to persuade Tayyip supporters to be with you yet you are doing the the most wrong thing you could do: giving a reason people to hate you and belive how right they are to support what they support (Tayyip in this example). 

It has no greater impact on things we want to change so going to streets just to fight police and give boring press statements should be considered as slactivism as well.
